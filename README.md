# üß† OpenAI-Agents: Learning Notes & Mini-Tutorial

This repository documents my learning journey with **OpenAI-Agents**, building upon the excellent work from:  
- [Datawhale China ‚Äì wow-agent (Chapter 03: openai-agents)](https://github.com/datawhalechina/wow-agent/tree/main/tutorial/%E7%AC%AC03%E7%AB%A0-openai-agents)  
- [OpenAI ‚Äì openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)

The goal is to **understand, experiment with, and re-implement** core ideas of the new OpenAI Agents framework ‚Äî including agents, handoffs, tools, and sessions ‚Äî in a simple, practical way.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is both a **learning note and a lightweight tutorial**, meaning the code and explanations may evolve, contain mistakes, or be open to optimization. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome!
