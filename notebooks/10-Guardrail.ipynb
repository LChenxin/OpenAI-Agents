    "# Chapter 10 — Guardrails \n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guardrails** run *alongside* your agents to validate and police behavior—before you spend tokens or ship a bad answer.  \n",
    "Example: you have a slow/expensive “smart” model for customer requests. A cheap/fast guardrail can first check if the user is trying to, say, offload their math homework. If yes, **trip the wire early** and skip the costly model. (Your wallet says thanks.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input guardrails** — run on the *initial user input*.  \n",
    "- **Output guardrails** — run on the *final agent output* (just before you return it).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input guardrails: how they run\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The guardrail receives **the same input** that would go to the agent.  \n",
    "2. Your guardrail function executes and returns a `GuardrailFunctionOutput`, which the SDK wraps into an `InputGuardrailResult`.  \n",
    "3. The SDK checks `tripwire_triggered`. If `True`, it raises `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`.  \n",
    "   You can then show a friendly message, ask for clarification, or block the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** Input guardrails only run when the agent is the **starting agent** of a workflow.  \n",
    "> They live on the agent (not on `Runner.run`) because different agents can (and should) have different guardrails—keeping the logic co-located and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use which\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input guardrail:** block unwanted categories early (policy, abuse, out-of-scope, quota, homework filters, etc.).  \n",
    "- **Output guardrail:** inspect the final answer (PII leakage, format/schema validation, safety tone checks) and either fix, reject, or request a revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design tips (tiny, practical)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep the guardrail model **cheap & fast**; reserve the big model for approved requests.  \n",
    "- Return **structured results** (e.g., Pydantic types) with a clear boolean like `is_allowed` and a short `reason`.  \n",
    "- Log tripwires via **hooks** so you can audit *when/why* a guardrail fired.  \n",
    "- Fail **closed** by default: if the guardrail crashes, don’t silently allow risky input.\n",
    "\n",
    "> TL;DR: Guardrails are your **bouncer** and **final QA**. Filter bad inputs up front, verify outputs at the end, and keep your main agent focused—and affordable.\n"

    "## 02. Input guardrail — minimal working example (with notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we define a **guardrail agent** that classifies whether a request is *math homework*.  \n",
    "Our guardrail function runs this cheap classifier first and returns a `GuardrailFunctionOutput`.  \n",
    "If `tripwire_triggered=True`, the SDK raises `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` and **blocks** the main agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "1) User input → `math_guardrail` runs first.  \n",
    "2) It calls `guardrail_agent` (which returns a `MathHomeworkOutput` Pydantic object).  \n",
    "3) If `.is_math_homework` is `True`, we **trip the wire** and skip the expensive agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this pattern?**  \n",
    "- Keep the **guardrail model** fast/cheap.  \n",
    "- Keep the main agent focused on approved work.  \n",
    "- Use structured output (`output_type`) to avoid parsing brittle text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** In notebooks, use top-level `await`. In scripts, wrap with `asyncio.run(...)`."
