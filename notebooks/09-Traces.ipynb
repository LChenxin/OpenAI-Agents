    "**Traces** are end-to-end records of a whole ‚Äúworkflow run,‚Äù made up of multiple spans. A trace carries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **workflow_name** ‚Äî The logical workflow or app name (e.g., ‚Äúcode_generation‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomer_support‚Äù).  \n",
    "- **trace_id** ‚Äî The unique ID for this trace. If you don‚Äôt provide one, we‚Äôll mint it for you.  \n",
    "  Must match the format: `trace_<32_alphanumeric>` (because chaos needs a little order).  \n",
    "- **group_id** ‚Äî Optional grouping key to link multiple traces from the *same session* (e.g., a chat thread ID).  \n",
    "- **disabled** ‚Äî If `True`, the trace won‚Äôt be saved (useful when you want silence, not surveillance).  \n",
    "- **metadata** ‚Äî Optional key‚Äìvalue tags for filtering, dashboards, and future-you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spans** are time-boxed units of work inside a trace. Each span includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **started_at** / **ended_at** ‚Äî Timestamps to mark its glorious beginning and dignified end.  \n",
    "- **trace_id** ‚Äî Which trace this span belongs to (family matters).  \n",
    "- **parent_id** ‚Äî Optional pointer to the parent span (so you can build the family tree).  \n",
    "- **span_data** ‚Äî Details about the operation. Examples:  \n",
    "  - `AgentSpanData` ‚Äî Info about the agent that ran.  \n",
    "  - `GenerationSpanData` ‚Äî LLM generation specifics.  \n",

    "- **Guardrails**  \n",
    "  When a safety check trips, you‚Äôll see a **`guardrail_span()`**. Seatbelts on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handoffs**  \n",
    "  Delegations show up as **`handoff_span()`**. Pass the baton, keep the trace.\n",

    "- Use **`trace(...)`** or per-run **`RunConfig`** to set a custom **`workflow_name`**, **`trace_id`**, **`group_id`**, and **`metadata`** (because dashboards love tidy labels).\n",
